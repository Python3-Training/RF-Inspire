# Java Examples
Our mission is to help testers better master the [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org).

Here is how we can use RF to build & test Java at the CLI.

The techniques demonstrated herein will also work with other command-line tools, as well.

NOte: Be sure that Java's JDK is located along your System Path!

p.s. If you are just getting started, the first thing you'll want to do is to review [the standard libraries](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/), certainly [the built ins](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/libraries/BuiltIn.html).
