# Java Examples
Our mission is to help testers better master the [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org).

Here is how we can use RF to build & test Java at the CLI.

The techniques demonstrated herein will also work with other command-line tools, as well.

## Notes
Be sure that Java's JDK is located along your System Path!

If you are just getting started, the first thing you'll want to do is to review [the standard libraries](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/), certainly [the built ins](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/libraries/BuiltIn.html).

## White Box Testing
If you are looking to do "white box" testing - or are wondering what "test first" coding is all about - then you may also enjoy my [core Java](https://github.com/Java-9000/Java-1000) demonstrations.
