# GNU C/C++ Examples
Our mission is to help testers better master the [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org).

Here is how we can use RF to build & test C/C++ at the CLI.

The techniques demonstrated herein will also work with other command-line tools, as well.

## Notes
Be sure that GNU's C/C++ Compiler (`gcc`) is installed and located along your System Path!

If you are just getting started, the first thing you'll want to do is to review [the standard libraries](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/), certainly [the built ins](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/libraries/BuiltIn.html).

## C/C++ Coding
When you need to learn more about identifying & testing past, present, and future C/C++ code bases then you may also enjoy my [C/C++]([https://github.com/Java-9000/Java-1000](https://www.udemy.com/course/gnu-cpp-1000/?referralCode=4499B8A33F74E9AAB54D)) educational opportunities.
