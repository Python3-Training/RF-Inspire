# Welcome to RF-Inspire!
The mission of the RF Inspire Project is to help testers better master the [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org). From building & testing C/C++, Java, .Net, and (of course!) interfacing with Python there is always something weird - yet wonderful - to discover about Robot Frameworks?

If you are just getting started, the first thing you'll want to do is to review [the standard libraries](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/), certainly [the built ins](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/libraries/BuiltIn.html). 

Starting out, my first examples use [Builtins](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/libraries/BuiltIn.html), [String](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/libraries/String.html), [Dialogs](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/libraries/Dialogs.html), and [Process](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/libraries/Process.html).

## zPlan
Moving forward the plan is to use RF to test everything I love to geek over. Targeting everything from AWS & CORBA to XML/RPC, thus far we've cobbled together some ideas for building and / or testing:

[The RF Proper](https://github.com/Python3-Training/RF-Inspire/tree/main/Robot101)

[Java Programs & Archives](https://github.com/Python3-Training/RF-Inspire/tree/main/JavaExamples)

[Python Scripts](https://github.com/Python3-Training/RF-Inspire/tree/main/PythonExamples)

[XMP/RPC](https://github.com/Python3-Training/RF-Inspire/tree/main/Robot101/0400_XML_RPC)

## zSchedule
Next we will be providing some inspirations for building / testing (and / or tormenting?) C, C++, C#, and VB.Net... 

Will be doing much the same for CORBA, IIOP, Sqlite, AWS & others thereafter... I might even toss-in a Docker / K8s folder of 'testpirations as well?

## zSupport?
If you want to support the effort, I seek no donations. Instead, simply feel free to purchase one of [my educational](https://www.udemy.com/user/randallnagy2/) or [printed](https://www.amazon.com/Randall-Nagy/e/B08ZJLH1VN?ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1&qid=1660050704&sr=8-1) productions?
