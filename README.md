# Robot-Framework
Our mission is to help testers better master the [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org).

If you are just getting started, the first thing you'll want to do is to review [the standard libraries](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/), certainly [the built ins](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/libraries/BuiltIn.html). 

Starting out, my first examples use [Builtins](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/libraries/BuiltIn.html), [String](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/libraries/String.html), [Dialogs](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/libraries/Dialogs.html), and [Process](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/libraries/Process.html).
