# Welcome to RF Inspire!
The mission of the RF Inspire Project is to help testers better master the [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org). From building & testing C/C++, Java, and (of course!) interfacing with Python there is always something weird - yet wonderful - to discover about Robot Frameworks?

If you are just getting started, the first thing you'll want to do is to review [the standard libraries](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/), certainly [the built ins](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/libraries/BuiltIn.html). 

Starting out, my first examples use [Builtins](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/libraries/BuiltIn.html), [String](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/libraries/String.html), [Dialogs](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/libraries/Dialogs.html), and [Process](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/libraries/Process.html).
